## Game instructions
In this game, gaining money is done by betting on horses. The player initially has $5000 that they can spend either on unlocking new breeds or betting on horses. There are also 3 breeds Eriskay, Haflinger, and Aegidienberger that are unlocked by default. 

If the horse you bet on wins, you will gain 20% from the money that you betted. Otherwise, the money will be lost. There is also a way to gain money from selling horses if the horse will have higher confidence than when you bought it. Display and analyze horse statistics and bet on the horse that you think will win.

Feel free to send any suggestions to farhad.garaisa05@gmail.com or fork the repository to make your own changes.

Have fun playing my game!
